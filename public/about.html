<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I am Chandan Yadav currently persuing my B-tech from one Visveshwarya National Institue of Technology, It is one of the best Engineering Institute of the country.
  It is Ranked 6th by the NIRF.I am currently a prefinal year student.

</p>

<p>As Carl Jung says 
  "Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. 
  Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes." 
  I started my journey by exploring myself by participating in various activites
some of them includes, Prayaas (social workers club) then switching to committe head of Logistics and Hospitality of Aarohi(Central India's largest cultral fest) for second years and simultaneously joined TEAM 911 (Dance club) and participated in "Ala Danse" (A dance competition organised by VNIT NAGPUR).
  Apart from this, I have also spend time working in group doing mini projects few of them are Smart board display, Sun tracking Solar pannel and motor controller. Also I have keen interest in coding which 
  doesn't stop me from exploring COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING and DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS. I remembered spending hours to think for an approach and finally getting my code accepted is the probably the best feeling of my life :)

</p>

<p>
  Learning new skill is like going on an adventurous trip alone which open various aspects of looking at a particular thing.
   Currently, I am exploring my wings on WEB Development and in future will be exploring APP Development on both ANDROID and IOS.
   Now, I am a prefinal year student and half a way of my B-tech  I have realized, it's the only one thing which makes you intelligent and successful that is HARD WORK!
   Never aim for sky, aim for something which the world belives it's impossible to achive and then with your hard work make impossible as I AM POSSIBLE.
